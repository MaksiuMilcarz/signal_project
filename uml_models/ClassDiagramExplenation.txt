The class diagram depicts the structure and relationships of classes within the cardio_generator system. 
At the core is the HealthDataSimulator class, responsible for orchestrating data generation and output strategies. 
It maintains an outputStrategy attribute, allowing flexible output configurations.

Four output strategies are supported: ConsoleOutputStrategy, FileOutputStrategy, WebSocketOutputStrategy, 
and TcpOutputStrategy. Each strategy implements the OutputStrategy interface, defining a output() method for 
transmitting data. ConsoleOutputStrategy is the default option. Also, WebSocketOutputStrategy owns a private 
class SimpleWebSocketServer responsible for server activities specific for this project.

These strategies facilitate modular and extensible data output. Additionally, the HealthDataSimulator class 
orchestrates the simulation process through PatientDataGenerator Interface, which is realized by 
BloodSaturationDataGenerator, BloodPressureDataGenerator, BloodLevelsDataGenerator, and ECGDataGenerator classes. 

Each of these classes inherits a generate() method responsible for generating data for each patient and then 
outputting it with a user-specified OutputStrategy.
