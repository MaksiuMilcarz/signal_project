State Diagram
    State Diagram depicts the creation of alert and possible error along the way. Once created the alert
    is sent to the medical staff and ready to be actknowledged. After being actknowledge, the staff can either 
    resolve the issue themselves by improving the patients treatment 

    OR wait for the patient to automatically 
    get better and the issue to resolve itself.



Sequence Diagram
    The sequence diagram depicts the alert generation process, starting from patient data detection. 
    The AlertGenerator interacts with DataStorage to confirm trends or retrieve past incidents. 
    Once confirmed, the AlertGenerator creates and sends alerts. Medical staff receive and Acknowledge alerts, 
    triggering necessary interventions to resolve the issue 

    OR the issue resolves itself, a.k.a. petient gets better.

    If however the data storage disconfirms the trends based on past data, then the alert is not created 
    and the problem is resolved for the time being.
